"""Run Codex read-only, with the sandbox nailed shut.

A thin wrapper around `codex exec` / `codex exec resume` that guarantees exactly
one thing: Codex runs read-only. That guarantee is what makes it safe to put this
call on a permission allowlist instead of answering a prompt every review round.

WHY THE WRAPPER EXISTS (measured 2026-08-27, codex-cli 0.149.1; every row is a
write attempt into an empty git directory, with a positive control -- without one
a "did not write" result would be worthless, since it could also mean the probe
never writes):

    exec -s read-only                                             -> no write
    exec -s read-only -c sandbox_mode="danger-full-access"         -> no write   (-s wins)
    exec -s danger-full-access                                     -> WRITES     (positive control)
    resume -c sandbox_mode="read-only" -c ..."danger-full-access"  -> WRITES     (last -c wins)

So for `exec` with an explicit `-s read-only`, the mode cannot be prised open. For
`resume` it can: there is no `-s` there, and a later `-c` beats an earlier one. A
permission rule only matches the START of a command and cannot catch that. This
wrapper can, because it inspects the arguments itself.

This file is the CANONICAL implementation. Repos receive a copy at
`tools/codex_ro.py`; `scripts/wrapper_drift.py` reports copies that fell behind.

It replaces the earlier PowerShell version (`codex_ro.ps1`) for two reasons: it
runs on macOS as well as Windows, and it builds the child's argv as a LIST.
PowerShell's `Start-Process -ArgumentList` does not quote, which is what made
argument injection through `-Model` and `-c` possible there (audit 2026-08-28,
two CRITICAL findings). With a list there is no command line to inject into.

WHAT AN ACCEPTED CALL STILL CANNOT DO (audit 2026-08-30, two CRITICALs)
    - widen its own write confinement. `--allow-path` and CLAUDEX_ALLOWED_PATHS
      arrive on the same unattended approval as the call, and --out-file is
      unlinked while --err-file is truncated. They now widen READS only; write
      targets stay in the repo and the OS temp dir, always.
    - point a write target at a symlink, a directory, a device or a Windows
      junction (audit 2026-09-02: `Path.is_symlink()` alone missed junctions,
      which need no special privilege to create -- see `_is_reparse_point`),
      or at a name that already hard-links to other data (`_has_other_hardlinks`)
      -- all checked before the unlink/open, which is O_NOFOLLOW on POSIX so
      that gap cannot be raced there. Windows has no such flag; see the
      residual gap noted for `open_for_write` below.
    - define or re-enable an MCP server. Codex runs those as separate processes
      OUTSIDE the sandbox, so `-c mcp_servers.*` is refused like the sandbox keys,
      and so is `-c profile=` (a profile carries its own sandbox_mode).
    - name an arbitrary write directory via CLAUDEX_SCRATCH_DIR on Windows (audit
      2026-09-02, CRITICAL). Write targets there are limited to the repo, its
      `.claudex-tmp/`, and the OS temp dir -- fixed candidates the wrapper picks
      itself, never one supplied through the environment.
    - replace the Codex executable via CLAUDEX_CODEX_BIN (audit 2026-09-02,
      CRITICAL). That override is gone; only PATH lookup and the fixed macOS
      bundle path resolve which binary runs.

⛔ RESIDUAL GAPS, stated rather than papered over (audit 2026-09-02):
    - On Windows, the repo, `.claudex-tmp/` and the OS temp dir are still ASSUMED
      private, not verified -- `_is_private_dir()` cannot read a directory's
      ACL/DACL and returns True unconditionally there. A shared checkout or a
      shared temp dir on Windows is not actually screened. Closing this needs
      real Windows ACL/DACL inspection of every ancestor, which this wrapper
      does not implement (see `_is_private_dir`'s docstring). Only the
      environment-settable scratch dir was removed as a candidate, because that
      one-line removal closes a real hole; a half-built ACL check would not.
    - On Windows, the reparse-point/hard-link checks in `prepare_write_target()`
      run, then the file is opened separately in `open_for_write()` -- there is
      no O_NOFOLLOW there, so a second attacker with write access to the SAME
      directory could still swap the leaf between the two calls. This is a
      narrower window than before (it now needs a second attacker inside an
      already-private-assumed directory, not just an env var), not a closed one.
    - PATH-based Codex resolution is unpinned: whichever `codex`/`codex.cmd`
      resolves first on PATH runs, and PATH itself can be attacker-influenced.
      Removing CLAUDEX_CODEX_BIN closes the environment-override door but not
      this one -- pinning PATH resolution needs a decision about what "the
      trusted Codex install" even means on a given machine, which this fix does
      not make for you.

Exit codes:
    0    Codex ran and produced a non-empty answer
    1    Codex exited 0 but the answer file is empty -- the classic expired-token
         case: exit 0, a valid thread_id, and the 401 only in stderr
    2    refused: bad arguments, a path outside the allowed roots, a write target
         that is not a plain file, a file that cannot be read or opened, or a
         config override that would touch the sandbox
    124  timeout -- treat as a failure, do not blindly retry
    127  codex executable not found
    else Codex's own exit code

No filesystem failure escapes as a traceback: every path this wrapper opens,
reads, deletes or creates reports through the codes above instead.

    On POSIX the question is real and answered for real. The rule is not "is
    anything world-writable" — that was the first version, and it was wrong in a
    way that only Linux showed: it refused every harness scratchpad under `/tmp`
    while accepting the identical layout on macOS, where `gettempdir()` happens
    to return a per-user path.

    What actually protects a directory entry is the **sticky bit**. `/tmp` is
    `drwxrwxrwt`: world-writable, but only an entry's owner may rename or unlink
    it. That is the whole reason `mkdtemp` is considered safe there. So an
    ancestor passes when it is not world-writable, OR when it is sticky and
    owned by root or by us. The leaf itself must be ours and closed to group
